simple-router
================
In this assignment you will be writing a simple router with a static routing table. Your router will receive raw Ethernet frames. It will process the packets just like a real router, then forward them to the correct outgoing interface. Weâ€™ll make sure you receive the Ethernet frames; your job is to create the forwarding logic so packets go to the correct interface.
